# Nemesis-Tracker
A streamlined objective tracker for Nemesis% speedruns in Final Fantasy X


## How to run

* Download the [Java Runtime Environment](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre9-downloads-3848532.html) from oracle.com
* [Download the Nemesis Tracker jar](https://github.com/jozborn/Nemesis-Tracker/releases)
* Double-click to run

## Controls

* Left-click a fiend button to increase its capture count, and right-click to decrease it.
* For arena objectives, left click to mark them as done, right click to unmark them.
* After all objectives are met, the `Nemesis` tab will unlock. I'll try to make something fun happen when you click that button.

## Buttons

* The tracker automatically backs up after every change you make, so if the program crashes or you close it accidentally, you can hit `Load Backup` to pick up where you left off.

* Only use the `Save` button whenever you save your game during a run. If you die, click `Revert` to reset progress to your last save. This can save you several minutes of backtracking to the Monster Arena just
