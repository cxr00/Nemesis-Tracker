# Nemesis-Tracker
A streamlined objective tracker for Nemesis% speedruns in Final Fantasy X


## How to run

* Download the [Java Runtime Environment](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre9-downloads-3848532.html) from oracle.com
* [Download the Nemesis Tracker jar](https://github.com/jozborn/Nemesis-Tracker/releases)
* Double-click to run

## Controls

* Left-click a fiend button to increase its capture count, and right-click to decrease it.
* For arena objectives, left click to mark them as done, right click to unmark them.
* After all objectives are met, the `Nemesis` tab will unlock. I'll try to make something fun happen when you click that button.

## Buttons

* The tracker automatically backs up after every change you make, so if the program crashes or you close it accidentally, you can hit `Load Backup` to pick up where you left off.

* Only use the `Save` button whenever you save your game during a run. If you die, click `Revert` to reset progress to your last save. This will at least save you the time of backtracking to the Monster Arena just to figure out how much progress you've lost.

* When resetting, use `Reset`. **BE CAREFUL**. This will reset the backup as well, so only use this when you are done with your current run or are starting a new one.

## The Viewport

To provide a cleaner view for your stream, a secondary "Stream Viewport" window shows a summary of your progress. This is a separate window from the control panel you will use to track objectives. Hopefully this makes it easier to showcase progress to your viewers without the bulky control panel messing with your stream's vibe.

To add the viewport to your scene, select the **Nemesis Tracker Stream Viewport** window.
